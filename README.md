#What ?

This was my Internship project in Sopra, India. I had to produce an analysis of sentiment from tweets extracted from twitter which was then parsed and sentiment words were extracted. The goal was to find trends and analyse what people thought about that particular trend, which could then be used to make videos relevant to current trends for more viewership.
